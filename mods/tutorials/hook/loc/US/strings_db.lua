TrainingOfficer = "Training Officer"

FAF_TUT_Common_IntroChoice_Dialogue = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Welcome commander, choose if you want to hear the basic information about the map, watch an example build order or try the build order yourself."
FAF_TUT_Common_IntroChoice_Title = "What do you want to do?"
FAF_TUT_Common_IntroChoice_MapInfo = "View basic map info"
FAF_TUT_Common_IntroChoice_ExampleBO = "Watch the build order"
FAF_TUT_Common_IntroChoice_TryBO = "Try the build order"
FAF_TUT_Common_StartBuildOrder_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Let's watch an example build order now."
FAF_TUT_Common_StartBuildOrder_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Hold down your 'SHIFT' key to see the command queue of the units. You can also select the ACU, Engineers or Factories to see their build queue. In case you need a bit more time to follow the build order, you can adjust the speed with the '+' and '-' keys, or Pause the game with the 'II'-Button on the top middle of the screen."
FAF_TUT_Common_EndBuildOrder = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Now you should know the basics about this map. It's time for you to try the build order yourself."

FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_MapInfo_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Welcome to this Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever map tutorial. This tutorial will teach you about the map Eye of the Storm. Let's get started."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_MapInfo_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Eye of the Storm is a 10x10km Land/Water map. This map is very versatile in terms of strategy. All types of units can be useful here, Land, Air and Navy are equally strong. For now let's take a look at the key features of the map."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_StartPosition = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Here is your starting position with 4 Mass Extractors (mexes) and a hydro."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_Lamp = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This little lamp contains 300 mass, which is a very useful boost to your early economy. There is one in every corner of the map. Hold down Shift+Ctrl to view reclaim numbers."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_EastPath1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The sea is surrounded by small land paths with small arms, which contain some Mass Extractors (mexes) and reclaim. This one leads to the eastern expansion."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_EastPath2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This area contains 5 Mass Extractors (mexes) and some reclaim. The ACU will be sent here to secure this position, and if possible the nearby expansion as well."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_SouthPath = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This is the second path that leads to the southern expansion. As you can see, here the 5 Mass Extractors (mexes) and reclaim are closer to your base so they will be relatively safe. No need to send your ACU this way."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_Middle = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The island in the middle of the map counts as an expansion as well. The 4 Mass Extractors (mexes) and various reclaimables can give you a nice advantage. Also, the island is quite easy to defend once it has been secured."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_OpponentSpawn = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This is the starting position of your opponent."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_LandFirst_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This build order will focus on heavy T1 Air spam to gain early air control, followed by the use of Bombers and Gunships to deal damage."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_LandFirst_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: A Land Factory is built first, followed by 2 Power Generators (pgens), 3 Mass Extractors (mexes), 3 more pgens and an Air Factory."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_ACUMove = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After finishing its build queue, the ACU will move to the east expansion. Secure some Mass Extractors (mexes) and reclaim the big rocks on the way there."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_FactoryQueue_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The first Land Factory builds 5 Engineers (engis), 2x Tank + Scout, 2-4x times a mix of 2 engies and 2 tanks and after that only engies on repeat."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_FactoryQueue_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Changing factory rally points will affect which way the units will leave the factory, you can save some time by exploting that mechanic."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_FirstEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The first engineer (engie) builds the last core Mass Extractor (mex) and then goes to the south to build the hydro, an Air Factory and more Power Generators (pgens)."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_SecondEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second engineer (engie) assists the first one."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_ThirdEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The third engie reclaims the lamp and expands east, building mexes and radars on the \"arms\"."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_FourthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The fourth engie expands south, grabbing the arms along the way. Don't forget to build the T1 PD to protect the path to your base, since we wont be sending a lot of units there early on."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_FithEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The fifth engie goes to the middle island. Get the reclaim before building the mexes. The mass you reclaimed is safe in your pockets, while mexes need to pay for themselves first."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_EngiAirFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second Air Factory that is built by the engies builds a queue of 1 Scout and 4 inties. We go for a 4:1 ratio here because you are going to have multiple Air Factories so you will also have enough scouts with a higher ratio."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_ACUAirFactory_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The Air Factory built by the ACU build a queue of 1 Bomber, 1 Scout and 4 Interceptors (inties). Build the bomber first to kill the engie of your opponent that might go to the middle island."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_ACUAirFactory_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The Scout that is built after the Bomber will spot the target for the Bomber. This can either be the engie heading for the middle or one of the two engineers expanding to the sides. Keep in mind that the one going to the middle has higher priority. This needs good timing so dont't worry if you can't execute it the first few times."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_TankScout1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Send the first Tank and Land Scout to protect the engie going south because it's the only one going there. Better make sure it survives."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_TankScout2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second pair of tank+scout protects the engie going east. Since the ACU is going there as well, this engie has a lower priority than the one going south."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_SixthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The sixth engie builds a Land Factory followed by a Naval Factory."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_SecondFactory_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second Land Factory will be your main Land factory. Queue up a mix of 5 Tanks, 1 Land Scout, 2 Artilleries and set the waypoint to the east expansion to assist your ACU to make sure you can secure it. But don't forget to set repeat build!"
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_SecondFactory_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Depending on the pressure from the south you can send some units there if needed."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_SeventhEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The seventh engineer will start reclaiming in your base, use the attack move for it."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_EighthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The eighth engie should assist the first one with building power."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_NinethEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Nineth engi will do some more recliaming."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_TenthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The tenth engineer will build another Land Factory."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_AirScout1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Send the first air scout through the middle to find out if there's an engineer from your opponent going there. After that fly over the main base."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_AirScout2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Use your Air Scouts to spot engineers you could snipe with Bombers. It's also good to see where your opponent's ACU is going so you could divert more units to where they'll be needed."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_ThirdAirFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your third Air Factory assists one of the others. In case you have air control, you can mix in more Bombers to get more damage done or upgrade the factory to T2 to access Gunships."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_NavalFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The Naval Factories only produce Submarines (subs) for now. Build submarines instead of Frigates first because they counter Frigates and Frigates can't raid any mexes on EotS. If you manage to kill the naval production of your opponent, you can switch to Frigates for their radar and Anti Air capabilites."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_MoreLandfactories = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: When you manage to get some mexes out on the map you can afford to build some more Land Factories. You can either build them in your main base to pressure the south, or in your eastern expansion to pressure your opponent's main base."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_FollowUp_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After you have your start settled out, you have a lot of options to go for. T2 Air is a good option, because you should win air with your heavy air build. However you can also increase your land spam more or go for T2 Land."
FAF_TUT_EotS_BO_FollowUp_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: T2 Navy is also a very strong option, but it is more expensive and you have to make sure to not lose map control. Therefore it is an option for the later game. Good Luck Commander!"

FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_MapInfo_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Welcome to this Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever map tutorial. This tutorial will teach you about the map Four-Leaf Clover. Let's get started."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_MapInfo_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Four-Leaf Clover is a 10x10km land map. This map is all about the reclaim, as you will see. Now let's take a look at the key features of the map."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_StartPosition = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: You start in one of the corners with 4 Mass Extractors (mexes) and a close Hydrocarbon Power Plant (hydro). However they are further spread out than on other maps so make sure to use full build range of your ACU."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_Backdoor = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: As you saw in the overview already, a big rock in the middle gives each 'leaf' its circular structure. This offers a way around the mountain directly in the back of your base. It's very important to protect this entrance against raiding units."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_EnemyStartPosition = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your opponent starts in the opposite corner of the map."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_Expansions_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The empty starting positions function as expansions."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_Expansions_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Since the access point to each 'leaf' is connected only to the middle of the map, the player that manages to take control of the middle has higher chances of securing the expansions and winning the game."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_Expansions_3 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Using transports to drop units to the expansions is one of the common strategies on this map."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_MidReclaim_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Now, I told you earlier Four-Leaf Clover is all about the reclaim. There is a huge amount in the middle. Press 'Ctrl+Shift' after the cinematics end to see the values."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_MidReclaim_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The total value of the middle reclaim is 1600 mass which is enough for 2 T2 mex upgrades. So you should invest to get at least half of it."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_ReclaimBehindBase = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: But there's a lot more reclaim around the map than just in the middle, as you can see here."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_OtherReclaimInBase1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Groups of rocks can be found around the hills. You will have to spend some APM on that since the engies on attack move or patrol will reclaim trees as well."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_OtherReclaimInBase2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: All 4 'leaves' are identical, it follows that the reclaim spots in each 'leaf' are also identical."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_LandFirst_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This buildorder relies on getting some reclaim from the middle, if that doesn't work, you have to reduce the number of engies building factories, however this will be repeated later again."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_LandFirst_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Land Factory is built first, followed by 2 Power Generators (pgen) and 3 mex. After that 1 more pgen and a Land Factory. Remember to use the full build range, by setting a move command in front of the building."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_LandFirst_3 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Factory builds 4 engies, 1 tank+scout, 1 engie, 1 tank+scout, after that a mix of 2 engies and 2 tanks."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_LandFirst_4 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After finishing all buildings the ACU will move towards the middle and build 2 mexes on the way. Then you want to deny your enemy´s access to one leaf by building a T1 Point Defence there (T1 PD)."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_FirstEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The first engie builds the last of the core mexes followed by a hydro, an Air Factory, 4 pgens and 4 Land Factories."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_SecondEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second engie goes to the big stockpile of stones and gathers some reclaim. This engie should constantly reclaim stones, they give more mass than trees. Once all of the stones have been reclaimed, move the engie to some other stones to reclaim them."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_ThirdEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The third engie tries to get some of the middle mass and expand afterwards."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_FourthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Fourth engie will assist the first one with building your main base."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_TankScout1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The first tank and scout will protect the engie going for the middle mass, send them there immediately."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_SecondFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second Land Factory will be your main Land Factory. Queue up a mix of 5 tanks, 1 landscout, 2 arties and set the waypoint towards the middle. Also don't forget to set the factory on a repeat build!"
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_FithEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The fifth engie expands towards the west and builds all mexes on the way. At the end it builds a radar and a T1 PD to protect the path to the back of your base. Afterwards you can try to expand further."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_ACUMoveToMid = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Now that your second Land Factory is finished, the ACU goes to the middle. Always use your ACU early on in the game for securing map control as it is your strongest unit at this stage of the game."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_AirFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: You can try to go for an early T1 bomber to kill engies in the enemy base. Queue up a mix of 1 bomber, 1 scout and 3 interceptors (inties). The scout will be used to identify targets for the bomber."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_TankScout2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second tank and scout will protect the engie expanding west."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_SixthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The sixth engie assists the second engie to reclaim some stones. This is in a case your engie at the middle gets killed or you can't get the middle mass for some other reason."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_SeventhEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The seventh engie grabs more reclaim as well."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_BomberScout = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Now send your scout and bomber to the enemy base. The scout will arrive there before the bomber, use the vision it gives to manually target engies with your bomber."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_FactorySpam = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Remember to give every other Land Factory an assist command on the second Land Factory you've built."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_EighthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Depending on your mass situation the eighth and ninth engies grab reclaim or expand towards the east where your ACU is."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_Powerspam_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After your Land Factories are up, give one engie the order to build more pgens. The others can be send to the front to reclaim wrecks after a fight, or build radars."
FAF_TUT_FourLeaf_BO_Powerspam_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Now you have to try to secure an expansion. One thing you can also go for is a gun upgrade on your ACU, if you have at least around 400-500 total power income. Good Luck commander!"

FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_MapInfo_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Welcome to this Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever map tutorial. This tutorial will teach you about the classic 1v1 map Loki. Let's get started."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_MapInfo_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Loki is a 10x10km land map, the most played format in 1v1. This map is suitable for a lot of different strategies, but we will stick to T1 landspam at first. For now let's take a look at the key features of the map."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_StartPosition = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: You start in one corner of the map, with 4 Mass Extractors (mexes)."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_TwoMexHydro = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The back of your base is pretty safe against raiding and the hydro will offer you a nice powerboost."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_ReclaimNearBase = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This reclaim is important to boost your buildorder."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_ThreeMexHillside = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your first and most important expansion is this one. As you can see there are 3 mexes and a lot of reclaim. If you manage to secure it and get engies here to reclaim, you are going to have a strong early game economy. Don't rush for the civilians, they don't give a lot of mass."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_TwoMexSide = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Some more mexes here. Those don't really count as an expansion. Most of the time 3 or 4 mexes in one spot are called an Expansion."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FourMexCorner = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Here in the corner with 4 mexes is the biggest expansion on your side of the map."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_Pond = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: There is a small pond between your base and the expansion, which only hover or amphibious units can cross, which means it is difficult to reinforce that position from your mainbase. However it can also be helpful as it blocks ground access to your base, unless enemy hover or amphibious units exist."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_ThreeMexTop = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This 3 mex expansion is very close to the one in the corner. If you manage to secure this expansion the one behind is generally protected aside from aerial drops. To achieve that, we will send the ACU to this position."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_Choke = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The direct path to the mainbase of your opponent is only a small choke. This is an obstacle for your armies, so better avoid it with bigger forces. If your units are split up by the terrain or buildings, the enemy will find it easy to destroy them."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_PlateauWest = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The main area where army manoeuvres will take place are these plateaus."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_InitialBO_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: A Land Factory is built first, followed by 2 Power Generators (pgens) and 2 Mass Extractors (mexes). Then 3 more pgens and 1 Land Factory. After that, again 3 pgens, but this time an Air Factory."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_InitialBO_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After finishing all buildings the ACU will move to the Hillside Expansion and build a Land Factory there before moving further to the north."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_InitialBO_3 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The Factory builds 3 engineers (engies). Then 1 tank and 1 scout to protect your expanding engineers or for raiding enemy engis."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_InitialBO_4 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After that, 3 more engies and 1 tank+scout, then follow this up by an equal mix of engies and tanks."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_InitialBO_5 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Changing factory rally point will also affect which way the units will leave the factory, you can save some time by that."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FirstEngineer_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The first engie builds the other 2 mexes in the starting position and then takes the western route towards the top left expansion. It will build those 2 mexes and a hydro with radar on it's way there."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FirstEngineer_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After crossing the pond, build a Land Factory first to secure the expansion. In case your engineer gets killed it will be faster to rebuild it from that factory rather than having to send a new one from the main base."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_SecondEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second engie will reclaim the rocks near the base."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_ThirdEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your third engie should go to the Hillside Expansion and build the mexes there. Once they are up, reclaim the rocks."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_TankScout = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: These engies will be protected by your first tank. Send a scout with it to spot the incoming units sooner."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_SecondFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second Factory will be your main Land Factory. Queue up a mix of 5 tanks, 1 landscout, 2 arties and set the waypoint out of your base. Don't forget to set the factory on a repeat build!"
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FourthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Fourth engie expands east. It is likely, that this engie wont be able to secure the 3 mex expansion, but you might get some mass before the enemy is there to destroy it."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FithEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Order the fifth engie to assist your ACU to get the buildings done faster."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_SixthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your sixth engie also goes to the Hillside Expansion to reclaim rocks."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_AirFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The Air Factory builds a queue of 1 Air Scout and 3 Intercepters (inties). That way you always have Air Scouts available and their existence should remind you to scout."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FactorySpam_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: By the time your seventh engie is built, the ACU will be done building and leaves the base. At that point select both engies in your base and build 3 more pgens and 4 more Land Factories."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FactorySpam_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The ACU will move to the Hillside Expansion to build a factory there. After that continue to the north for the expansion with 3 mexes."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_EighthEngineer_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The eighth engie assists building the Land Factories."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_EighthEngineer_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: All other Land Factories should assist the second Land Factory."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_Powerspam = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The next two engies will build more pgens, because you will need a lot of power as soon as you get all the reclaim from the Hillside Expansion. Don't forget to include one Energy Storage to more easily manage your power situation and to be able to Overcharge with your ACU."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_ReclaimFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The ACU is now building the factory on the Hillside Expansion. This factory will produce only engies to reclaim the stones as fast as possible."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FollowUp_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Now you have a running base and a good amount of land spam going. Multiple options are available; you can either build more Land Factories or upgrade your mexes one by one, assisting with your engies which were previously building factories."
FAF_TUT_Loki_BO_FollowUp_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: If you watch replays of high level players on this map you're going to notice, that they are using a different buildorder. But that build is more complex and requires more experience. The buildorder you just saw is designed to be simple but still effective. Good Luck Commander!"

FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_MapInfo_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Welcome to this Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever map tutorial. This tutorial will teach you about the map Summer Duel. Let's get started."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_MapInfo_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Summer Duel is a 5x5km map. As most 5x5km maps it's all about the T1 land spam. For now let's take a look at the key features of the map."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_StartPosition = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your starting position has 4 Mass Extractors (mex) and a close hydro."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_Stones = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: There are quite a few rocks to reclaim around this hill. Make sure to get them as soon as possible to boost your economy."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_MainRoute = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Summer duel is defined by 3 choke points. This one is the direct route to your opponent's base and therefore the main battleground."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_NorthernChoke = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: By using the side passes you can sneak some raiding parties around your opponent's main force."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SouthernChoke = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: But be careful to not get raided yourself. You can wall of the area if you want."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_ACURush_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: A common strategy on this map is to rush the enemy base with the ACU before building a second factory. To counter that, it is important to identify the rush in time."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_ACURush_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Therefore you send an early t1 landscout to the choke, as you will see in the buildorder. If the scout sees the ACU or gets killed you immediately build a T1 Point Defense (PD) in your base, before building further factories."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_LandFirst_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: A Land Factory is built first, followed by 1 Power Generator and 4 mexes. Then set a move command for the ACU towards the hydro and let it assist the second engie."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_LandFirst_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The Land Factory builds 3 Engineers (engies), 1 tank, 2 Landscouts, 2 engies and then a mix of 2 tanks and 1 engie on repeat."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_LandFirst_3 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Changing factory rally point will also affect which way the units will leave the factory, you can save some time by that."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_FirstEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The first engie builds the hydro and then mix of pgens and factories."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SecondEngineer_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second engie expands south towards the reclaim field and builds the mex on the way."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SecondEngineer_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: It's quite important to not lose this engie as the rocks give you good amount of mass. Your first tank will protect this engie."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_ThirdEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your third engie builds 2 mexes by heading north and then comes back towards the middle and builds the last mex there, and a T1 Radar."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_TankScout = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Send the first tank and scout to protect your engineer reclaiming the rocks."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SecondScout_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second scout gets sent to the middle to spot an incoming ACU rush, as it was explained in the map info."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SecondScout_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: If you spot an incoming ACU, cancel the current build queue and build a T1 PD immediately."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SecondFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The second Land Factory will be your main factory. Queue up a mix of 5 tanks, 1 scout, 2 arties and set the waypoint towards the middle choke point. Don't forget to set the factory on a repeat build!"
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_FourthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The fourth engie will assist the first one with building your base."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_FithEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The fifth engie builds the untaken mex in the south. After that the southern mex in the mid choke."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_DualTank = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The 2 tanks which are built now will protect the northern choke."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_ACUMove = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After the third factory is finished the ACU goes straight through the mid choke towards the enemy base. Now you set the waypoint of your factories close to the enemy base.That way the tanks arrive fast at the front to assist your ACU."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SixthEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The sixth engie will also assist with building the base."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_SeventhEngineer = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The seventh engie tries to take the northern mid choke mex."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_AirFactory = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The Air Factory builds a queue of 1 air scout and 3 interceptors (inties). The first air scout is done shortly before your ACU arrives at the enemy base, use it and scout what your opponent has before you attack."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_FollowUp_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: You are putting a great pressure on your opponent now, keep on spamming the units and try to reclaim the wrecks with engies, that way you will take the victory."
FAF_TUT_SummerDuel_BO_FollowUp_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: However don't be tempted to upgrade a mex as it is a big investment, which could, done at the wrong time, delay your unit production and lose you the game. Better invest spare mass into more Land Factories and tanks. Good Luck commander!"

FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_MapInfo_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Welcome to this Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever map tutorial. This tutorial will teach you about the classic 1v1 map Theta passage. Let's get started."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_MapInfo_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Theta is a 5x5 land map, the smallest basic size map in Forged Alliance. The most important strategy to learn for this map is T1 land spam which we will show you shortly. For now let's take a look at the key features of the map."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_StartPosition = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: You start in one corner of the map with 4 Mass Extractors close and a Hydrocarbon Power Plant. It is important to integrate the Hydrocarbon Power Plant into your opening build order because it is more efficient than T1 Power Generators."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_ReclaimNearBase = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: These three reclaim fields are important to boost your early land production."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_ReclaimMiddle = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The rocks around the arch in the middle are useful, it's even better if you can steal the rocks on your opponents side of the arch."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_MiddleWrecks = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The wrecks above the arch however have very little mass in them, don't waste time trying to reclaim them."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_InfoAboutMiddle = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Raids can often move through this passage, build a wall to block invaders or send your own units through to raid your opponent's Mass Extractors."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_BottomPassage = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: There are also rocks to reclaim in this area. A wall or point defence will stop intruders. Early raiding through this passage can deny several Mass Extractors, take care not to get raided from this position."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_NorthPart = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The open area at the north is the most important area of the map, it will be where the largest fights will happen. Keep you commander in this area and support him with the majority of your army."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_NorthPlateau = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The plateau above contains 2 Mass Extractors which are the most contested Mass Extractors. They are also the easiest to secure if you can grab them thanks to the small choke point units will have to use to reach them."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_NorthPlateau2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: If you can secure these two Mass Extractors for example with a Point Defense, you will have the map control advantage. Mantain this map control and you will be well on your way to winning the game."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_LandFirst_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: A Land Factory is built first, followed by a single Power Generator. Then 4 Mass Extractors along the way to the Hydrocarbon."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_LandFirst_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Be sure to place move orders closer to the Mass Extractors to utilize the full build range of your ACU. Build range is the small yellow circle on your HUD surrounding the ACU."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_LandFirst_3 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The first Land Factory will build 3 engineers. One for building your base and 2 for expanding. Then 2 tanks and 2 scouts to protect your expanding enginners and/or for raiding enemy engineers."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_LandFirst_4 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: After that you can build additional engineers and tanks. On a small map like Theta you should not build only engineers from your first factory since you will never need so many of them."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_LandFirst_5 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Changing a factory's rally point will also affect which way the units will leave the factory, you can save some time by doing that."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_FirstEngineer_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your first engineer will go to build a Hydrocarbon and then several Land Factories around a Mass Extractor. The ACU will assist it until the Hydrocarbon and at least one more factory are done."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_FirstEngineer_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Always try to place Land Factories around Mass Extractors and Air Factories around Power Generators to fully use the adjacency bonus (cost discount)."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_NorthEngineer_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Another engineer can expand to the top-left side. It will reclaim few rocks on it's way and build Mass Extractors. Try to secure the corner area by building a Point Defense and Walls there."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_NorthEngineer_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Additional radar in that position will help you spot enemy army movement. You can also move the engineer to the corner of the map. If your opponents over runs that position, there's a small chance that the engineer will survive and you can start rebuilding right away."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_SouthEngineer_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your third engineer will expand to the bottom. Try to secure the area with a Point Defense to deal with enemy attacks more easily."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_SouthEngineer_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This engineer also has an important task of building a T1 Radar next to the hill to give you intel on enemy unit movement."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_Raids_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your first two tanks will protect your expanding engineers. Sending a scout with them will help you spot the enemy units sooner and react in time."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_Raids_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Order the scout to assist the tank instead of ordering a move command to both of them to keep the scout covered behind the tank."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_SecondFactory_1 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Your second Land Factory will produce only attacking units. For the beginning you will need only tanks and scouts. A good ratio is 5 tanks to a single scout. Later you can add an artillery into the mix to deal with enemy Point Defenses."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_SecondFactory_2 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Once you build more factories, set them to assist this one. That way you need to set a build queue only on the one factory which will save you more time to micro your units."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_SecondFactory_3 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: This is also a time to move your ACU to the middle of the map to get the reclaim from there. Build a Mass Extractor that is on the way."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_SecondFactory_4 = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Newly built engineers will replace your ACU with building the base."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_MoreTanks = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Distributing other tanks will depend on your opponent's movement. Reinforce the bottom or top positions as needed. The scout you sent with the first tanks should show you how many units your opponent has in that area."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_ACUMiddle = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Try to reclaim as much rocks as you can with your ACU in the middle. It's very likely that you will encounter your opponent's ACU there. Ignore the incoming fire, reclaim what you can and retreat slightly to regroup with your army."
FAF_TUT_Theta_BO_MiddleRadar = "[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Make sure to build a radar in the middle of the map as well. Once the radar is up, you can use an engineer to reclaim anything that was left in that area."
