  {text = '[Tokyto]: Theta is a 5x5 land map, the smallest basic size map in Forged Alliance. The most important strategy to learn for this map is T1 land spam which we will show you shortly. For now let\'s take a look at the key features of the map.', vid = '', bank = '', cue = '', faction = 'UEF'},
}

StartPosition = {
	{text = '[Tokyto]: You start in one corner of the map with 4 Mass Extractors close and a Hydrocarbon Power Plant. It is important to integrate the Hydrocarbon Power Plant into your opening build order because it is more efficient than T1 Power Gerenators.', vid = '', bank = '', cue = '', faction = 'UEF'},

InfoAboutMiddle = {

BottomPassage = {

NorthPart = {

NorthPlateau = {
