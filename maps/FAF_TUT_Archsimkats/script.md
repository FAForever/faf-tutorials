-Coop
	Kurt Douglas -This is the commander Kurt, I am struggling to push out the fellow opponent, I require some assistance if HQ can provide.
	HQ operator -HQ operator Zugg here, how can I help you?
	Kurt Douglas -I repeat I require some assistance or I will be stuck here the whole day with this crybran.
	HQ -We only have some fresh recruits, will they be of any help to you?  
	Kurt -Ahh… Screw it… Ill take anything at this point.
	HQ -You will need to clear the “LZ” (Landing zone) so we can departure him safely to your area, can you do that? In the mean time we will prepare him for departure. Sorry sir, protocols.
	Kurt -Jesus how green is this guy…? Sigh… Alright ill clear the LZ, Ill inform you when it is done.
	HQ -Copy that. Zugg out.

-Player clears the LZ

	Kurt -LZ is clear just give me a moment to back away my units, ETA 15 seconds.

-Units moved out of the LZ

	Kurt -LZ clear, beam him in.
	HQ -Roger that.
-1.1.0 Tutorial frame work takes over to show him how base is built
1.1.1
	Mark Homer -I have safety arrived, status update.
	HQ -I am relinquishing my instructions to your senior. Try get this mission done by the end of the day. Zugg out.
	Kurt -Alright here is the deal, establish your base and let me know when you are done, then ill brief you on what your task will be.
	Mark -Roger that sir.

-Completes the base building

	Mark -Have done as you instructed, mission brief please.
	Kurt -Your task is simple… you probably already have some tanks on the field use them to clear the area up ahead.
	Debrius -What is this? Now they need two to take on one of me?
	Kurt -No, I just don’t want it to take the whole day.
	Debrius -You might not live long enough see the rest of this day… 
	Kurt -Sure buddy… Sure.
	Kurt -It seems like that bastard was not kidding and had plenty of units in reserve, ill need your help clearing them out.
	Kurt -I am expanding your operational area to come over here and help me out. Hurry.
	Mark -Ill do my best.

-Clears the attacking units

	Kurt -I see on radar that he has some reserved units for you, prepare for immediate attack.
	Mark -Roger that.
	Kurt -Try not die on me sir.
	Mark -Hmph... I will do my best.

-Clears the attacking units

	Kurt -You know Mark you are not half bad at this, now that he has expended his reserved army and feed it to our own via reclaim it is time to push back at him and see how does he like it.
	Mark -Tell me what you have in plan.
	Kurt -First ill need to expand your operational area and authorize the use of T1 artillery units, give me a moment.
	Kurt -Zugg we need you to expand the operational area for my dear ally along with other things in this request form, for a green guy, he sure is useful.
	HQ -It is not in our protocols to permit the recruits for more aggressive attacks…
	Kurt -Zugg I don’t want to be stuck here whole day… Give what I ask out of you.
	HQ -Fine but be warned, I have advised you not to do this.
	Kurt -Noted.
	Kurt -Alright new guy it is time to teach you about offensive operations. This will be bit more complex then it is in the books.
	Kurt -I want you to go up ahead and build some artillery units and take over the area up ahead, grab those three mass extractors and secure the area.
	Kurt -Good odds you will face some resistance in that area from enemy tanks and point defences so be prepared for a fight. If you are stalling on mass be sure to reclaim the leftovers that will boost you in the long run.
	Mark -What my units composition should be?
	Kurt -Leave it at 4 to 5 tanks, one scout and one arty and from there repeat.
	Mark -Roger that sir.
	Kurt -No need for formalities, You can just call me Kurt.
	Mark -Very well… Kurt.

-Clears the area

	Kurt -Alright area seems to cleared out, remember when there is three or more mass extractors like that close you want to secure it so you don’t lose it as easily in those chases we consider those an expansion. Now mark, in the books it should say how do we secure those.
	Mark -Yes with a forward factory for reinforcements and additional engineers to reclaim, a point defence so we can defend the incoming units and a radar so we can see the incoming units and properly prepare for it. 
	Kurt -Just like in the books, do that and let me know when you are done, don’t forget to reclaim, you don’t want to give that bastard anything so he does not use it on us. 
	Mark -Very well Kurt.
	Debrius -You are really naive fool if you think I gonna let you take control of that area without any consequences.
	Mark -I done securing the area, he is doing some small probing pushes but he ain't breaching this expansion no more.
-Secures the designated area. 
	Debrius -Naive UEF fool!
	Kurt -Wonderful to hear that, time for a last stage of this operation… Destroying him.
	Kurt -The plan is simple as it gets, kill his remaining army his point defences… buildings, radars, power and him.
	Kurt -Adjust your unit composition how you see it fit and eliminate him. The one who kills him first gets free round of beer.
	Mark -Sir I hate to disappoint you… but you will be paying.
	Kurt -Told you to not call me sir and we will see about that, it is a race now.
-Bonus objective; “kill” enemy acu before Commander Kurt Homer.
	Debrius -Rahhh! You will pay for what you did!
	Kurt -Watch out Mark… the fish is trying to leave the barrel.
	HQ -We have been notified that enemy ACU is going to a back of his base. Eliminate him and take control of the area, HQ out.
	Kurt -You heard the Zugg, time to wrap this up.

-Enemy ACU flew away in a transport with ~50% hit-points left.

	HQ -Well done it seems like he escaped but we can track him down, well done commanders.
	Kurt -Was this in the plan Zugg?
	HQ -Yes, we could not afford to give a hint that we are without proper air support in our own area there for we locked you down in a land battle. Now that he is going closer to his main base air battles are more favourable now. 
	Kurt -Shame we could not kill him here and now…
	HQ -Negative I have been instructed to lead him away from UEF ground.
	Mark -We should expect more difficult battle for the next round…
	Kurt -Yes it will probably not be easy.
	Mark -You still owe me beer however.
	Kurt -OH! I sorry I thought the aggrievement was who ever kills him FIRST! Far as I can see that grunt is still walking! Lets go! Time to go chase him down for good!
