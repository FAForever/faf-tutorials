StartPosition = {
    {text = '[{i TrainingOfficer}]: You start in one of the corners with 4 Mass Extractors (mexes) and a close Hydrocarbon Power Plant (hydro). However they are further spread out than on other maps so make sure to use full build range of your ACU.', vid = '', bank = '', cue = '', faction = 'UEF'},
}

Backdoor = {
    {text = '[{i TrainingOfficer}]: As you saw in the overview already, a big rock in the middle gives each \'leaf\' its circle structure.

Expansions = {

    {text = '[{i TrainingOfficer}]: The total value of the middle reclaim is 1600 mass which is enough for 2 T2 mex upgrades. So you should invest to get at least half of it.', vid = '', bank = '', cue = '', faction = 'UEF'},

ReclaimBehindBase = {
    {text = '[{i TrainingOfficer}]: But there\'s a lot more reclaim around the map than just in the middle, as you can see here.', vid = '', bank = '', cue = '', faction = 'UEF'},

OtherReclaimInBase1 = {
    {text = '[{i TrainingOfficer}]: Groups of rocks can be found around the hills. You will have to spend some APM on that since the engies on attack move or patrol will reclaim trees as well.', vid = '', bank = '', cue = '', faction = 'UEF'},

OtherReclaimInBase2 = {
    {text = '[{i TrainingOfficer}]: All 4 \'leaves\' are identical, it follows that the reclaim spots in each \'leaf\' are also identical.', vid = '', bank = '', cue = '', faction = 'UEF'},
